# <p align="center">GO4LUNCH</p>

Application developed for the P7 of my Android developer formation with OpenClassrooms
  
Go4Lunch is a application designed for workplace teams. It simplifies the process of finding a nearby restaurant, selecting one's choice, and coordinating lunch plans with colleagues. Just before lunchtime, the app sends notifications to remind users to join their coworkers for a lunch break.

that he has chosen, the address, as well as the list of colleagues who will come with him.
